# Deep-Learning-for-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-An-Artificial-Neural-Network-Approach


This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Handwritten digit classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, and this project explores the application of deep learning techniques to solve this task.

Features:

    Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture tailored for handwritten digit classification.
    Dataset preprocessing and augmentation techniques for enhancing model robustness.
    Training and validation scripts with support for monitoring key performance metrics
    Jupyter notebooks illustrating the step-by-step development process and analysis of results.
    A pre-trained model and instructions for using it to classify new handwritten digit images.

Dataset:
The MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the field of machine learning, was used for training and testing the model. It consists of a large collection of grayscale images of handwritten digits along with corresponding labels.

Usage:

    Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
    Set up the required Python environment using the provided requirements.txt file.
    Follow the Jupyter notebooks to understand the data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation steps.
    Experiment with hyperparameters, architecture modifications, or different optimizers to observe their effects.
    Use the pre-trained model for inference on new handwritten digit images.
